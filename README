A KendoUI DataSource that wraps a Backbone Collection.

The following items are not currently supported: (Listed in order of planned future support)
  - Sorting
  - Querying
  - Paging
  - Filters
  - Aggregates
  - Grouping
  - Setting of values through the data function
  * Backbone models with attributes named "id" or "uid" due to conflicts
    with Kendo's use of these properties.  The Kendo id property is alwayss
    set to the Backbone's cid value.
  * options.autoSync is assumed to be on, but sync only copies the values to backbone. It does not call backbone sync

  key: * future support is not planned

Assumptions:
  - The read function is not implemented (the caller should use Backbone functions instead)
